### Enhancements Since Interview
1. I implemented the front-end technologies Gulp, Bower, and SASS. Furthermore, I used the JavaScript framework Angular for the functionalities on the page.

2. The search within filter, pagination, and selecting the amount of items to view at once functionalities are working. I modularized the code by putting the Platform search filters as well as the games in arrays and ng-repeated them onto the page.
