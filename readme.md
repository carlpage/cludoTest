### Enhancements Since Interview
1. I implemented the front-end technologies Gulp, Bower, and SASS. Furthermore, I used the JavaScript framework Angular for the added functionalities on the page.

2. The search within filter, pagination, and selecting the amount of items to view at once functionalities are working. I modularized the code by putting the platform search filter as well as the games from the hypothetical search result in arrays and ng-repeated them onto the page.
